# TicTacToe

This is a code representation of the board game, Tic Tac Toe.

Tic Tac Toe is a two player game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turn putting their mark on the grid in an attempt to get three marks in a row.

Games can end in either a win or a draw where a player has gained three marks in a row or a win is not possible for either player.

## Background

The reason for creating this game was my experience in a recent job interview where I was asked to create this game and wasn't terribly good at it. After the interview I decided to learn how to make this game and practice techniques so I wouldn't be left in any doubt if and when the opportunity came again.

I am aiming to develop this application in two stages. The first stage will be to get something basic up and running in the form of a simple console app. Secondly, to improve the implementation and architecture by adhering to SOLID principles. Separation of concerns here will be a key feature.
